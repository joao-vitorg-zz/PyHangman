## How to play
Playing this Hangman game is easy: Simply download the repository to your computer and run `main.py`! The game comes with its own included word list, `wordlist.txt`, which contains a list of 853 English words.

## Customization
Want to specify your own list of words in place of the included `wordlist.txt`? Simply overwrite that file with a text file of your own of the same filename, with each word on a separate line. Compound words with spaces involved work, too (eg., ice cream).

You can also add new words onto the included `wordlist.txt` file to be used in the game. Words can be added at any place in the file but, again, add one word per line.

## Requirements
- Have Python 3.3 installed on your computer
